# Genetic_Screen_Analysis
Custom-written genetic screen analysis script that performs multiple analyses on the same dataset within two separate variables (Normalization and ZDist). The Normalization variable will calculate normalized values (due to a log2 transformation of the available median values) and the log2 fold change values (by calculating and dividing each normalized value against the Empty Vector (EV) mean for each strain/experiment/replicate number). The ZDist variable will calculate a multitude of variables including the normalized values (as above), the median absolute deviation (MAD), the overall median value (MEDI), Zscore, normdist, 1-normdist, and the robust Zscore. The robust zscore (or MAD method) is superior to a normal zscore as it is less sensitive to outliers, by using MAD and median, compared to the mean. In general, an outlier is considered to be less than -3.5 or greater than 3.5 when using a robust zscore.
